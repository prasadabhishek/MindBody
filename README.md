###Design Approach

The design involved simple use of MVC architecture using asp.Net C#. The webpage is spread out across Model , Views and their Controllers.
The drop down is populated on page load using the Staff Service which is used as a SOAP WSDL and resides in the Service reference folder.


###Technologies Used
Apart from the basic C# , the gridview was designed using [JQgrid](http://jqgrid.com/) which is a javascript library. This involves wrapping the data from the controller
into json data in order to display in the Jqgrid.
